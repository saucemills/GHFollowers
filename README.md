# GHFollowers

This app was made as a project app from Sean Allen's iOS Dev Take Home Project course on
Teachable. The app allows the user to search for a username from Github API's database. The 
app will then display that user's followers in a custom 3 column flow layout collection view.

In the collection view, you can utilize the search bar, and through using a diffable data source,
the followers displayed will automatically update. 

If you select any of the users, it will bring up profile information on that user including name,
location, company, bio, number of repos and gists, and number of followers and followings. This page also
allows you to go to the user's profile through Safari or to bring up a collection view of their
followers.

I learned and was able to hone many skills though this course including:
* Custom Views
* Network Calls and parsing JSONs
* Caching information
* Pagination
* Custom errors and error message alerts
* Persistance through setting favorites
* Debugging
* Optimization
